Multiple filter criteria combine to further restrict the results. Note: Currently, filter returns data from only the last 90 days. If the orderIds parameter is included in the request, the filter parameter will be ignored. The available criteria are as follows: creationdate The time period during which qualifying orders were created (the orders.creationDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example: creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders created on or after the given timestamp. creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders created between the given timestamps, inclusive. lastmodifieddate The time period during which qualifying orders were last modified (the orders.modifiedDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example: lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders modified on or after the given timestamp. lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..2016-05-31T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders modified between the given timestamps, inclusive. Note: If creationdate and lastmodifieddate are both included, only creationdate is used. orderfulfillmentstatus The degree to which qualifying orders have been shipped (the orders.orderFulfillmentStatus field). In the URI, this is expressed as one of the following value combinations: orderfulfillmentstatus:{NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders for which no shipping fulfillments have been started, plus orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not completed. orderfulfillmentstatus:{FULFILLED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders for which all shipping fulfillments have been completed, plus orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not completed. Note: The values NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, and FULFILLED can be used in various combinations, but only the combinations shown here are currently supported. Here is an example of a getOrders call using all of these filters: GET https://api.ebay.com/sell/v1/order? filter=creationdate:%5B2016-03-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z%5D, lastmodifieddate:%5B2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..%5D, orderfulfillmentstatus:%7BNOT_STARTED%7CIN_PROGRESS%7D Note: This call requires that certain special characters in the URI query string be percent-encoded: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ = %5B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] = %5D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ = %7B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| = %7C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} = %7D This query filter example uses these codes.

      description: 'This method allows a seller (opted in to eBay Managed Payments) to issue a full or partial refund to a buyer for an order. Full or partial refunds can be issued at the order level or line item level. The refunds issued through this method are processed asynchronously, so the refund will not show as ''Refunded'' right away. A seller will have to make a subsequent getOrder call to check the status of the refund. The status of an order refund can be found in the paymentSummary.refunds.refundStatus field of the getOrder response. Note: eBay Managed Payments is currently only available to a limited number of US sellers, but this program is scheduled to become available to more sellers throughout 2019 and beyond.'

The issueRefund method supports the legacy API Order IDs and REST API order IDs. Note: In the Trading API (and other legacy APIs), Order IDs are transitioning to a new format. The new format is a non-parsable string, globally unique across all eBay marketplaces, and consistent for both single line item and multiple line item orders. These order identifiers will be automatically generated after buyer payment, and unlike in the past, instead of just being known and exposed to the seller, these unique order identifiers will also be known and used/referenced by the buyer and eBay customer support. For developers and sellers who are already integrated with the Trading API''s order management calls, this change shouldn''t impact your integration unless you parse the existing order identifiers (e.g., OrderID or OrderLineItemID), or otherwise infer meaning from the format (e.g., differentiating between a single line item order versus a multiple line item order). Because we realize that some integrations may have logic that is dependent upon the identifier format, eBay is rolling out the Trading API change with version control to support a transition period of approximately 9 months before applications must switch to the new format completely. See the OrderID field description in the GetOrders call for more details and requirements on transitioning to the new Order ID format.'

      summary: Update evidence
      description: 'This method is used by the seller to update an existing evidence set for a payment dispute with one or more evidence files. The unique identifier of the payment dispute is passed in as a path parameter, and unique identifiers for payment disputes can be retrieved with the getPaymentDisputeSummaries method. Note: All evidence files should be uploaded using addEvidence and updateEvidence before the seller decides to contest the payment dispute. Once the seller has officially contested the dispute (using contestPaymentDispute or through My eBay), the addEvidence and updateEvidence methods can no longer be used. In the evidenceRequests array of the getPaymentDispute response, eBay prompts the seller with the type of evidence file(s) that will be needed to contest the payment dispute. The unique identifier of the evidence set to update is specified through the evidenceId field, and the file(s) to add are identified through the files array in the request payload. The unique identifier for an evidence file is automatically generated and returned in the fileId field of the uploadEvidence response payload upon a successful call. Sellers must make sure to capture the fileId value for each evidence file that is uploaded with the uploadEvidence method. The type of evidence being added should be specified in the evidenceType field. All files being added (if more than one) should correspond to this evidence type. Upon a successful call, an http status code of 204 Success is returned. There is no response payload unless an error occurs. To verify that a new file is a part of the evidence set, the seller can use the fetchEvidenceContent method, passing in the proper evidenceId and fileId values.'

To determine if ''Collect and Remit'' taxes were added into this total value, the user can check for the corresponding lineItems.ebayCollectAndRemitTaxes and the lineItems.taxes containers in the response. If both of these containers appear for this line item in the response with a taxType value of STATE_SALES_TAX (in US) or GST (in Australia or New Zealand), the ''Collect and Remit'' tax amount that the buyer paid is in this amount. Sellers should be aware that the ''Collect and Remit'' tax that the buyer pays for the order will initially be included when the order funds are distributed to their PayPal account, but that PayPal will pull out the ''Collect and Remit'' tax amount shortly after the payment clears, and will distribute the tax to the appropriate taxing authority. Previous to this change, PayPal would strip out the ''Collect and Remit'' tax before distributing order funds to the seller''s account. This logic change does not apply to sellers who are in eBay managed payments, so the amount in this field will never reflect any ''Collect and Remit'' tax, even if the order is subject to ''Collect and Remit'' tax.'

Only domestic shipments are available for eBay Guaranteed Delivery. At this time, eBay Guaranteed Delivery is only available to a select number of sellers on the US and Australia sites, but this feature will be enabled on more eBay sites in 2019. There are two different eBay Guaranteed Delivery options - ''Handling time'' option and ''Door-to-Door'' option. With both options, the seller is commiting to getting the order delivered to the buyer within three business days after purchase. With the ''Handling time'' option, the seller''s stated handling time for a listing must be ''same-day'' or ''1-day'', and at least one of the available shipping service options should have a shipping time that guarantees that the buyer receives the order on time. With this option, eBay will set the ''ship-by date'' and expected delivery window for the seller, and the seller should just make sure they physically ship the order by the shipToDate. With the ''Door-to-door'' option, the seller must create regional shipping rate tables (with shipping costs and delivery times based on destination regions), and then apply these regional shipping rates/delivery times to the listing. If a ''Door-to-door'' order does not arrive on time, the seller must refund the buyer the full shipping cost (if any), and the buyer also has the option of returning the item for a full refund, and the seller will also have to pay the return shipping cost. With ''Handling time'' option, as long as the seller meets the stated handling time, and ships using the correct shipping service option, eBay will refund the buyer the shipping cost and pay for return shipping label (if buyer wants to return item) if the order arrives after the expected delivery time. For more information on the details and requirements of eBay Guaranteed Delivery, see the Offering eBay Guaranteed Delivery help topic.

To determine if ''Collect and Remit'' taxes were added into these amount fields, the user can check for the lineItems.ebayCollectAndRemitTaxes and the lineItems.taxes containers in the response. If both of these containers appear for one or more line items in the response with a taxType value of STATE_SALES_TAX (in US) or GST (in Australia or New Zealand), the ''Collect and Remit'' tax amount that the buyer paid are in these amounts. Sellers should be aware that the ''Collect and Remit'' tax that the buyer pays for the order will initially be included when the order funds are distributed to their PayPal account, but that PayPal will pull out the ''Collect and Remit'' tax amount shortly after the payment clears, and will distribute the tax to the appropriate taxing authority. Previous to this change, PayPal would strip out the ''Collect and Remit'' tax before distributing order funds to the seller''s account. This logic change does not apply to sellers who are in eBay managed payments, so the amount in this field will never reflect any ''Collect and Remit'' tax, even if the order is subject to ''Collect and Remit'' tax.'

      description: 'This type is used by the taxIdentifier container that is returned in getOrder. The taxIdentifier container consists of taxpayer identification information for buyers from Italy, Spain, or Guatemala. It is currently only returned for orders occurring on the eBay Italy or eBay Spain marketplaces. Note: Currently, the taxIdentifier container is only returned in getOrder and not in getOrders. So, if a seller wanted to view a buyer''s tax information for a particular order returned in getOrders, that seller would need to use the orderId value for that particular order, and then run a getOrder call against that order ID.'
